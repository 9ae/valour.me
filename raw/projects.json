			"about": "The FirstHand project is all about addressing the need for a smarter, more flexible astronaut's glove. The current space glove presents many challenges, including comfort, hand injuries, and the ability to receive input and provide feedback. \n\n At its core, FirstHand is a sophisticated thermostat for your hand. It uses small temperature sensors and heating/cooling elements for each finger to provide essential temperature control for astronauts. The feedback system is built around an Intel Edison board mounted to the forearm. We also built a companion Android app that is able to control and monitor the temperature with simple voice commands. \n\n NYC Space Apps 2015: Best Hardware Project, IBM Bluemix Prize",
