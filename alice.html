<p>My name is Alice Qing Wong. I am a professional software developer and hobbyist artist. 
    I am 24 years old, with the first 4 years living in my home-city Guanzhou; the latter 20 moving all over the geographic Long Island 
    (Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk). </p>

<p>When I am not programming or playing around with pictures. I like to jog. I am a big anime/manga and Harry Potter series fan, 
    in fact it was the main reason why the 12-year old me got into web design/developement in the first place. 
    Recently, I've gotten back into reading novels and poetry.

<p><b>Elementary schools</b> [1988-2000] <br/>
As any kid, I was a day dreamer. I am a only child, and my parents moved around a lot. As a result, I recall most of my childhood years keeping myself company. 
As a kid, I wanted to be many things. First I wanted to be an artist and astronomer. Later I wanted to be an inventor (it was before I realized they don't exist anymore, or rather are renamed to engineers), and then a song writer.
